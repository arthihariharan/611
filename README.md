Hi, This is my 611 Data Science Project. 

I am interested in analysing the proteome and genomic profile in Glioblastoma cancer.

The dataset used for this project is the CPTAC Gliobastoma cohort. 

There are 7 files with information about proteome, phosphoproteome, Genome, Mutations, Survival and Clinical information. 

The datasets used here can be downloaded from https://www.linkedomics.org/data_download/CPTAC-GBM/. The proteome data can also be found in Proteomics Data Commons (PDC).
